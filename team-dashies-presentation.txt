Mobile Order and Pay has taken the world by storm

It's a Plexure success story, and it hasn't yet even gone live.

MOP is the future of the fast food ordering experience, and we are very excited to announce that from today, your customers can enjoy the MOP experience right from the comfort of their own homes.

that's right, today we present you the Delivery Module for the Mobile Order and Pay platform.






>> map view 


the Delivery Module is built in to plexure.io

it gives you a full view of all delivery orders, live

it gives you control of your driver distribution

and most importantly, it gives you ownership of the ordering experience, from the app right to the customer's doorstep



allow us to demonstrate. matt?





>> matt places the order


the new delivery option fits seamlessly into the existing MOP user experience

customers place an order and confirm their location

their order status is then displayed, so they can track their food




>> map view


once the order is confirmed, it is sent to the closest restaurant

the closest available driver is then assigned to the order, and begins driving to the restaurant

as the driver arrives, the order is automatically sent to the kitchen

the driver picks up the order, and delivers it to the customer's door


is that awesome or what





>> dashboard view


by the way i know we promised you live dashies

as an added bonus, all delivery data can be charted and tracked in real-time

live dashboards can be generated for all order stats, and saved for later viewing





>> AWS


lambda to ingest order data into kinesis firehose

kinesis firehose for handling the stream of live data from drivers and orders

elastic search and kibana for real time visualisation

s3 for data warehouse of historical stream data

our web service is hosted on elastic beanstalk, supporting driver routing and tracking





>> final pitch


the MOP Delivery Module removes the requirement for Uber Eats or other external vendors.

it puts quality assurance of the delivery experience back in the hands of McDonalds

delivery is optimised for freshness, with drivers automatically routed to the store closest to the customer's home

drivers are a centralised mcdonalds resource, allowing franchise owners to opt-in without hiring more staff


the MOP Delivery module is the future.

speak to myself or one of the team members after the event,

we would love to help you get your orders on the road.


thank you
